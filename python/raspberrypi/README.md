# DFRobot_IIC_Serial.py
This is an IIC to dual UART module with 1Mbps IIC transmission rate, and each sub UART is able to receive/transmit independent 256 bytes FIFO hardware cache. It can be used in the applications requiring the transmission of large amounts of data. <br>
The band rate, word length, and check format of every sub UART can be set independently. The module can provide at most 2Mbps communication rate, and support 4 IIC addresses. Four such modules can be connected to one controller board to expand 8 hardware serial port. <br>

## Methods

```C++
'''
  @brief Constructor
  @param sub_uart_channel sub UART channel, WK2132 has two sub UARTs: SUBUART_CHANNEL_1 or SUBUART_CHANNEL_2
  @Parame IA1:  corresponds with IA1 Level(0 or 1) of DIP switch on the module, and is used for configuring 
  @n the IIC address of the 6th bit value(default: 1).
  @Parame IA0:  corresponds with IA0 Level(0 or 1) of DIP switch on the module, and is used for configuring
  @n IIC address of the 5th bit value(default: 1).
  @n IIC address configuration: 
  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
  0  IA1 IA0  1   0  C1  C0  0/1
  @n @n IIC address only has 7 bits, while there are 8 bits for one byte, so the extra one bit will be filled as 0. 
  @n The 6th bit corresponds with IA1 Level of DIP switch, can be configured manually.
  @n The 5th bit corresponds with IA0 Level of DIP switch, can be configured manually. 
  @n The 4th and 3rd bits are fixed, value 1 and 0 respectively.
  @n The values of the 2nd and 1st bits are the sub UART channels, 00 for sub UART 1, 01 for sub UART 2. 
  @n The 0 bit represents the operation object: 0 for register, 1 for FIFO cache.
